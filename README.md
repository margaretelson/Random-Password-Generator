# Random-Password-Generator

## Description

On this project, I refactored a code to randomly generate a password consisting of special characters, numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters. When the user clicks the button 'generate', a password will be created for them consisting of the selected criteria that is presented to them in pop-up form at the top of the screen.

This website was created using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I think in the future, I would like to implement a 'history' or 'recently generated passwords' section under the button to help with user accessibility.
